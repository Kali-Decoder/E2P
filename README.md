# Problem Statement
The inefficiencies of current energy distribution marked by expensive power purchase agreements, operational inefficiencies, and insufficient revenue. Excessive reliance on non-renewable sources further exacerbates the issue. The problem of surplus renewable energy which could be sold to generate revenue.

# Solution
In addressing contemporary energy distribution challenges and envisioning the future of renewable energy, peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-grid (P2G) renewable energy trading emerges as an optimal solution. This innovative approach involves categorizing users based on their proximity and forming microgrids, allowing for independent energy trading. These microgrids are seamlessly integrated into the central grid to address any shortfall in energy requirements. This system not only resolves the inefficiencies associated with traditional energy operations but also contributes to the economic viability of electricity. By decentralizing energy trading, P2P and P2G renewable energy trading fosters a more resilient and sustainable energy ecosystem. It not only empowers individuals and local communities to actively participate in the energy market but also facilitates the efficient utilization of renewable resources, steering us towards a future where clean energy is both accessible and economically advantageous.

# Features

- (✓) P2P Transactions: Enables prosumers to sell excess energy to the grid and vice versa.
- (✓) Blockchain Trust: Utilizes blockchain for secure, transparent, and immutable transaction records.
- (✓) Prosumer Empowerment: Empowers prosumers to actively engage in the energy market.
- (✓) Real-time Monitoring: Monitors energy transactions and grid performance in real-time.
- (✓) Loyalty token: Sellers are provided with loyality tokens based on amount of energy they provided.
