# Problem Statement
Energy distribution is the biggest challenge in the push toward rural and urban electrification. Expensive power purchase agreements, poor infrastructure, inefficient operations, and inadequate revenue generation compel DISCOMs to make critical investments to improve the quality and continuity of power supply.

# Solution
In addressing contemporary energy distribution challenges and envisioning the future of renewable energy, peer-to-peer (P2P) renewable energy trading emerges as an optimal solution. This innovative approach involves categorizing users based on their proximity and forming microgrids, allowing for independent energy trading. These microgrids are seamlessly integrated into the central grid to address any shortfall in energy requirements. This system not only resolves the inefficiencies associated with traditional energy operations but also contributes to the economic viability of electricity. By decentralizing energy trading, P2P renewable energy trading fosters a more resilient and sustainable energy ecosystem. It not only empowers individuals and local communities to actively participate in the energy market but also facilitates the efficient utilization of renewable resources, steering us towards a future where clean energy is both accessible and economically advantageous.
